Active Shape Model - Should go pretty fast to implement, might need already segmentaded images but will need this for most
Snake segmentation - Similar to ASM but somewhat more flexible
Deep learning - Less experience with but could work
KNN - Easy to implement, but won't be enough
Bayesian - easy to implement, requires more test data tho
Histogram equalizer - same as KNN, might be able to combine with other methods
